def transform(

    method="DCT",
):
    """
    Performs Gaussian standardizing transform (ST) on data volume.
    The function may be used as a image/video preprocessing tool
    to reduce noise; reduce the Euclidean error of small pixel displacements.
    It can also be used as a step towards computing the Image Euclidean Dist.,
    see imed.distance().

    The ST transform can be performed on one or more correlated axes. This is
    specified using using `sigma` parameter.

    The function returns a volume with the same shape as `volume` that has been
    transformed using an ST frequency method, see `method`.

    ST return an altered volume that has the same dtype as `volume`.Currently,
    numpy operations on CPU are not faster when e.g. f32 is chosen over f64.

    Parameters
    ----------
    volume: array_like,
    data volume, for instance a 3D volume consisting of 2D images. May have
    any number of dimensions. ST should only be applied along axes of
    correlated elements. See `sigma` for such configuration.

    sigma: int or array_like,
    Gaussian 'blurring parameter'. Each value leads to a separate IMED
    similarity measure. If `sigma` is an int then that ST is performed
    along all axes of `volume`. Otherwise `sigma` must be array_like with
    dimension 1 and `volume.ndim` number of elements that each specify the
    sigma to be used along the respective axis. When `sigma = 0` is specified,
    that axis is skipped, i.e. no ST/convolution is performed along that these
    axes.

    method: str,
    Method of performing standardizing tranform: 'FFT' or 'DCT' (default).
    Two options provide different edge effects. DCT often provides more natural
    boundary effects in image processing and similar application.

    inv: bool.,
    If true, perform the inverse standardizing transform (deconvolution),
    for example in the context of regression problems. See eps parameter
    for optimal use.

    eps: float,
    If inverse transform is needed for the problem at hand, eps should be a
    small, positive float to avoid catastrophic noise amplification. The need
    increases with the magnitude of sigma. 1e-3 is a good starting point.

    Returns
    -------
    volume_ST: array_like,
    data volume that has undergone the specified standardizing transform.
    if imed scores are needed see imed.euclidean() and imed.distance().

    """
    Euclidean distance or pixel-to-pixel dissimilarity of data volumes.
    For a 3D volume/sequence of 2D images, one may require image-to-image
    distance. The optional parameter output_dims specifies the required
    number of dimensions for the output distance. If a single scalar output is
    expected, `output_dims = 0` should be selected (default).

    last ndim-output_dims axes.

    Parameters
    ----------
